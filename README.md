# Avocadomaton! - Avocado Classifier with Automaton Implementation

Simple in concept, yet an awesome exercise to implement the fundamental concepts of "Automata Theory". In this small project, my Automaton aims to properly classify avocados in two main categories:

1. Premium Avocados
1. Standard Avocados

But, not all avocados come in the same shape, size, and weight. For this exercise, we'll only consider the weight to classify them as follows:

1. If the avocado is **premium**, it can be considered either a "High Weight, Premium Avocado" or a "Low Weight, Premium Avocado".
1. If the avocado is **standard**:

    a. It will be classified as a "Low Weight, Premium Avocado" if its weight is considered low.
    
    b. It will be discarded if its weight isn't considered low.
